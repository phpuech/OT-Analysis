	abstract = {Cell shape and motility are primarily controlled by cellular mechanics. The attachment of the plasma membrane to the underlying actomyosin cortex has been proposed to be important for cellular processes involving membrane deformation. However, little is known about the actual function of membrane-to-cortex attachment (MCA) in cell protrusion formation and migration, in particular in the context of the developing embryo. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach to study MCA in zebrafish mesoderm and endoderm (mesendoderm) germ layer progenitor cells, which migrate using a combination of different protrusion types, namely, lamellipodia, filopodia, and blebs, during zebrafish gastrulation. By interfering with the activity of molecules linking the cortex to the membrane and measuring resulting changes in MCA by atomic force microscopy, we show that reducing MCA in mesendoderm progenitors increases the proportion of cellular blebs and reduces the directionality of cell migration. We propose that MCA is a key parameter controlling the relative proportions of different cell protrusion types in mesendoderm progenitors, and thus is key in controlling directed migration during gastrulation.},

	abstract = {How do cells process environmental cues to make decisions? This simple question is still generating much experimental and theoretical work, at the border of physics, chemistry and biology, with strong implications in medicine. The purpose of mechanobiology is to understand how biochemical and physical cues are turned into signals through mechanotransduction. Here, we review recent evidence showing that (i) mechanotransduction plays a major role in triggering signalling cascades following cell-neighbourhood interaction; (ii) the cell capacity to continually generate forces, and biomolecule properties to undergo conformational changes in response to piconewton forces, provide a molecular basis for understanding mechanotransduction; and (iii) mechanotransduction shapes the guidance cues retrieved by living cells and the information flow they generate. This includes the temporal and spatial properties of intracellular signalling cascades. In conclusion, it is suggested that the described concepts may provide guidelines to define experimentally accessible parameters to describe cell structure and dynamics, as a prerequisite to take advantage of recent progress in high-throughput data gathering, computer simulation and artificial intelligence, in order to build a workable, hopefully predictive, account of cell signalling networks.},

	abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) allows the mechanical characterization of single cells and live tissue by quantifying force-distance (FD) data in nano-indentation experiments. One of the main problems when dealing with biological tissue is the fact that the measured FD curves can be disturbed. These disturbances are caused, for instance, by passive cell movement, adhesive forces between the AFM probe and the cell, or insufficient attachment of the tissue to the supporting cover slide. In practice, the resulting artifacts are easily spotted by an experimenter who then manually sorts out curves before proceeding with data evaluation. However, this manual sorting step becomes increasingly cumbersome for studies that involve numerous measurements or for quantitative imaging based on FD maps.},
